# Comparing Weather, CO₂, and Climate Topology of Rome and Chicago

This project compares temperature, precipitation, atmospheric CO₂ trends,
and topological climate structure for Rome and Chicago, two cities located
at similar latitudes but with distinct climates.

We apply traditional statistical analysis and Topological Data Analysis (TDA)
to reveal differences in seasonal stability and climate variability.
